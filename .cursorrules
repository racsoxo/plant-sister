**Prompt for Composer:**

*Objective:*  
Develop an AI-powered app named **Plant Sister** to assist users in caring for their plants. The app should have the ability to recognize plant types via photo uploads or textual descriptions. It should also provide personalized plant care tips. The design should be sleek, user-friendly, and aligned with high standards of UX/UI akin to Apple apps. Ensure scalability for both web and mobile platforms.

*Key Features:*  
1. **Image Recognition:**  
   - Utilize state-of-the-art image recognition technology (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch models fine-tuned for plant species).  
   - Allow users to upload photos for real-time plant identification.

2. **Textual Identification:**  
   - Integrate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models) to identify plant species based on names or descriptions.  

3. **Plant Care Recommendations:**  
   - Generate dynamic care instructions tailored to the specific plant and user preferences.  
   - Include reminders for watering, fertilizing, and other plant care tasks.

4. **Database Integration:**  
   - Design and implement a database to securely store user information, plant data, and activity logs.  
   - Use relational databases like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for structured data, or NoSQL databases like **MongoDB** for flexibility.  
   - Ensure robust authentication and encryption for user data privacy.

5. **Cross-Platform Support:**  
   - Build a progressive web app (PWA) for seamless access on web and mobile devices.  
   - Consider frameworks like **React Native** or **Flutter** for mobile apps.

6. **Scalable Backend:**  
   - Use cloud-based architecture (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) to manage user data, AI processing, and scalability needs.  
   - Integrate database solutions with backend frameworks like Node.js or Django.  
   - Implement APIs for seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and database.

7. **Apple-like Design Principles:**  
   - Adhere to Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) for a smooth, intuitive user experience.  
   - Incorporate visually pleasing animations and responsive layouts.

*Development Tools and Technologies:*  
- **Frontend:** React/Next.js for web; React Native/Flutter for mobile.  
- **Backend:** Node.js or Python (FastAPI/Django), integrated with serverless architectures where possible.  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB for data storage; Prisma or Sequelize for ORM if applicable.  
- **AI Features:** OpenAI APIs, custom-trained image classifiers, and GPT models for NLP.  
- **Design:** Figma or Sketch for prototyping, adhering to Apple HIG.  
- **Testing:** Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end testing.  

*Deliverables:*  
- A functional prototype with core features implemented, including a database integration.  
- A detailed README documenting architecture, features, and future scalability considerations.

*Timeline:*  
Deliver an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) within 8 weeks, focusing on core functionalities like plant identification, care recommendations, and database setup. Post-MVP phases to enhance UX/UI and add advanced features like social sharing and community discussions.
